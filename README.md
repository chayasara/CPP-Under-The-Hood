# CPP-Under-The-Hood
This project describes how OOP principles in cpp are translated to c, and basicaly imitates what goes on behind the scenes.
Background:
In the past, before cpp compilers existed, cpp code was translated to c by CFront. 
The code in this project resembles the code generated by CFront when using Polimorphism, Encapsulation and inheritance.
